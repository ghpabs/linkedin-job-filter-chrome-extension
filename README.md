“LinkedIn Job Filter” will clean up your newsfeed, keeping only potential job opportunities and hiding all the others posts.

This plugin is the result of my dissatisfaction with the quality of my newsfeed while job hunting.
Note that a very small number of non job opportunity posts might not be filtered at times.
